# Neuroscience Investigation

## Questions
  * What are myelin sheaths?
  * What is the difference between liquid & fluid intelligence?

## Terms

#### Prefrontal Cortex
* repetition helps prefrontal cortex remember
* deliberate practice

#### Neocortex
* tasks have to be challenging, but not overwhelming

#### Frontal Lobes
* studies show that your intelligence level depends on how selective you are when remembering information. (opencolleges)
* "Selective Attention" use it or lose it
* studies show that intelligence is more about how you control the spotlight of attention, giving promience to important, useful facts(opencolleges)
* active learning can help engage the subject in different ways, and help your brain retain the info.
* Don't zone out, bad for the brain, keep engaged w/ environment.
* Transfer info instead of just memorizing it, brain function is about turning the info you gather into big ideas.

#### Parietal Lobes
* It gains senses & navigation information from the body and processes it(primarily touch).
* If your brain can quickly and efficiently process all the information it is getting in, it will be a more effective learning tool.
* Tetris may help w/ parietal Lobes (opencolleges)

#### Occipital Lobe
* Improve performance by repeatedly imaging(visualization) a task as closely as possible

#### Broca's Area
* speech area, may be improved by doing tounge twisters
* being billingual is good for the brain

#### Other
* Temporal Lobes
* Supplementary Motor Area
* Eye Fields
* Visual Cortex
* Somatosensory Cortex
* Auditory Cortex
* Motor Cortex
* Sensory Cortex
