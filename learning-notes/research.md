## Ecocortex
"I'm not certain the causal link exists here. I too have a vast 'exocortex' but find my memory is still improving in efficiency, despite getting older.

As long as you use and challenge your real memory every day it will not atrophy (aside from the expected age-related issues...) so the answer here is to not offload everything onto a memory system, but only those things less commonly used (which would perform poorly in your memory anyway)

***To do this, a strict adherence to a usage plan could be useful - assess the info you are using or accessing. If you think you may use it again, or if you have used it twice, memorise it. otherwise leave it in secondary storage."*** - Stack Exchange #ecocortex
