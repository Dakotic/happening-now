# Notes on Studying

Learning is the product of mental effort and doing the right types of processing.

***Retrieval*** is one of the best things you can do for your memory. It has the two-fold effect of telling you what you don't know and even attempting to retrieve information is good for you. 

***Testing is important*** Instead of studying to learn and testing that learn, it is better to test in order to learn. Past exams, practice problems, write test questions. TEST TEST TEST OMGURD TESTS. This is better than repeat reading.

***Spaced Practice*** Really good for lasting performance. UGH. DO YOUR DAMN ANKI CARDS DAILY. If you haven't slap yourself.

Do not learn concepts completely sequentially, mix it up while you go along. Work on studying in different locations.
