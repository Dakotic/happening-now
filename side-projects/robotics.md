# Robotics

I have always been curious about Robotics and because of that, I have slowly collected some learning tools over the years.

### Lego NXT

I have a couple of NXT bricks, a bunch of parts, and a couple of books(will add links eventually). I built a bunch of stuff years ago when I was in high school, but all my NXT stuff has been in the closet since than. At some point in 2016 I hope to come back to them and learn the basics of robotics while also programming them in JavaScript or Python.

### Parallax Robot Kit

I also have a [Parallax robot Stingray](http://www.generationrobots.com/en/401389-robot-stingray-from-parallax-programmable-multicore.html) that has been collecting dust in a closet. I built the robot and did some basic programming with it but haven't touched it since. After I have spent some solid time with the Fredboard and NXT kit, I hope to come back to the Stringray Robot and do some cool programming projects with it.
