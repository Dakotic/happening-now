# Digital Painting

At the start of 2016 I bought myself a Wacom tablet to start my digital painting journey.

The [Wacom CTL-671](https://www.amazon.com/Wacom-CTL-671-Tablet-CTL671/dp/B013STQI50) has been sitting in my creative bin collecting dust. I got caught up with other projects and this got back logged. I have played around with it but to really get the ball rolling I need to spend a consistent amount of time practicing and learning. I am hoping to get the ball rolling near the end of the summer when some of my other projects will have hopefully ended.

When that time comes I plan on using [CTRL-Paint](http://www.ctrlpaint.com/) for the learning process. It is free and awesome. Check it out if you are interested in digital painting.
