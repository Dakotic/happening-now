# Lawrence in Arabia Comic

So I have a weird fascination with the T.E. Lawrence. Not sure why, but I do. Possibly because he encapsulated what it meant to be human?

Due to all that I am making a web comic of sorts as a fun way to practice my digital painting skills. I worked through the first two pages of many last fall, but have put this project on the back burner for now. Once I free up some time and get back into digital painting on a consistent level, then I will pick this back up. Here are the first two pages.
