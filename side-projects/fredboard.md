# Fredboard

I have a Fredboard, aka Freak Labs Breadboard, that I've been meaning to use as an introduction for "learning electronics with embedded programming using Arduino".

[User Guide](http://www.freaklabsstore.com/pub/FREDBOARD%20v1.0%20User%20Guide.pdf)

I have done some of the basic tutorials in the past, like making it sing, but I never really did a deep dive. I plan on blocking out some solid time for at least a couple of weekends to do some learning.
